# coding-test

You have to develop a single screen app with three tabs:

- The first tab is an image selector whose images are fetched from abihome-test.herokuapp.com/test/images
- The second tab shows the last image selected
- The third tab shows the previous image selected

It does not have to look great. Using raw elements is just fine. The main focus is on the code and structure. Write self­-documented code and/or documentation as you see fit.

Bonus Points if…

- You also write tests
- Classes are as reusable as possible
- You innovate on the architecture (MVC is OK, but take it as an opportunity to come up with something new/modern)

How to Run:
1. clone using git clone {url_repo}
2. navigate to project root folder
3. open project coding-test.xcodeproj
